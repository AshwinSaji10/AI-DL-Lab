        "The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is a classical decision-making problem where a set of actions (in this case, advertisements) is available, each providing a certain reward, but the actual reward distribution of each action is initially unknown. The goal is to choose actions in a way that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. At each time step, the agent must decide which action to take, balancing the trade-off between exploring new actions to learn their reward distributions (exploration) and exploiting the current best-known action to maximize immediate rewards (exploitation).\n",
